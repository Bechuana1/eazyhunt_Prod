the system design flow.
1.	Landlord/Caretaker registration
•	The landlord/caretaker visits the registration page and provides their full name, mobile number, email address (optional), and password.
•	The system validates the registration information and creates a new user account for the landlord/caretaker.
•	The landlord/caretaker is automatically logged in to the system.


2.	Apartment registration
•	The landlord/caretaker navigates to the "Register Apartment" page and provides the name of the apartment (optional), the county (with Kiambu as the default), the town (with Juja as the default), the landmark (optional), and the plot number (optional).
•	The landlord/caretaker can also provide a list of facilities available in the apartment, such as water, electricity, security, etc.
•	The system validates the information and creates a new apartment record, linked to the landlord/caretaker's account.
•	The landlord/caretaker is redirected to the apartment details page, where they can view and edit the apartment's information.

3.	Room listing

•	The landlord/caretaker provides the room's details, including the rental price, the room type (single, double, etc.), additional facilities (if any), and an image of the room.
•	The system validates the information and creates a new room record, linked to the apartment record and the landlord/caretaker's account.
•	The room vacancy status is set to "vacant" by default.


4.	Tenant booking
•	A tenant navigates to the apartment listing page and searches for available rooms in the desired location and price range.
•	When the tenant finds a room they are interested in, they click the "Book Now" button and are redirected to the booking details page.
•	The tenant provides their name, mobile number, and optionally their email address.
•	The system validates the information and creates a new booking record, linked to the room record and the tenant's account.
•	The room vacancy status is updated to "booked", and the landlord/caretaker is notified of the booking confirmation.
•	The tenant is redirected to a confirmation page and is provided with the landlord/caretaker's contact information to make arrangements for the move-in.
